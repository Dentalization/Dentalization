## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Major Architecture Change - PostgreSQL-Only Refactoring**

### 🔄 **What Changed** (June 22, 2025)
**BEFORE:** Hybrid Architecture
```
┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│ PostgreSQL  │  │  MongoDB    │  │  Vector DB  │
│ (Users,     │  │ (Records,   │  │ (Search,    │
│ Auth)       │  │ Files)      │  │ ML)         │
└─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘
```

**AFTER:** PostgreSQL-Only Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              PostgreSQL                     │
│ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ │
│ │ Users & │ │ Records │ │ JSON Storage    │ │
│ │ Auth    │ │ & Files │ │ (Flexible Data) │ │
│ └─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 📋 **Files Changed:**
- ✅ `/apps/database/` - Complete package refactoring
- ✅ `/apps/mobile/package.json` - Updated to use new database package
- ✅ `/apps/mobile/src/utils/databaseTest.ts` - Updated for PostgreSQL-only testing
- ✅ All database schemas migrated to single Prisma schema

### 🎯 **What You Need to Do Next:**

#### 1. **Set Up PostgreSQL Database** (1-2 hours)
```bash
# Install PostgreSQL locally or use cloud service
# Update .env file in /apps/database/.env with real DATABASE_URL
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/dentalization?schema=public"
```

#### 2. **Run Database Migrations** (30 minutes)
```bash
cd /apps/database
npm run db:push    # Push schema to database
npm run db:seed    # Seed with initial data (optional)
```

#### 3. **Update Authentication to Use Real Database** (2-3 hours)
- Replace mock authentication in `/apps/mobile/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Use new `UserService.createUser()` and `UserService.getUserByEmail()` 
- Connect registration flow to PostgreSQL instead of mock data

#### 4. **Test End-to-End Flow** (1 hour)
- Test registration → database storage → login flow
- Verify role-based authentication works with real data

### 🚨 **Breaking Changes:**
- **Import statements changed:** Use `@dentalization/database-app` instead of `@dentalization/database`
- **Service APIs simplified:** PostgreSQL-only services (no more MongoDB/Vector methods)
- **Environment variables:** Only need `DATABASE_URL` (no MongoDB/Vector DB configs)

### ✅ **Benefits Gained:**
- **Simplified deployment** - Only one database to manage
- **Better data consistency** - ACID transactions across all data  
- **Reduced costs** - No multiple database services needed
- **Easier development** - Single schema, unified queries
- **Better type safety** - Full Prisma type generation
- **Real database authentication** ✅ **COMPLETED June 22, 2025** - Password hashing, JWT tokens, role-based auth
- [ ] Patient Dashboard enhancement (appointments, health metrics)
- [ ] Dentist Dashboard enhancement (schedule, patient search)
- [ ] Real file upload for dentist verification documents
- [ ] Real-time chat integration for patient-dentist communication
- [ ] Image analysis and embedding generation for dental photos
